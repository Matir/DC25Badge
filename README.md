== Matir's DEF CON 25 Badge ==

This is an unofficial badge I made for DEF CON 25.  It's a blinding party-style
badge with 48 individually addressable RGB LEDs.  Off an adequate battery (a
medium LiPo) you can run all lights at max brightness, but that is *bright*.

This is intended as a one-time release for others to learn from and/or remix the
firmware.  I don't plan to take pull requests since it will be over and I'll be
on to another project by the release.  :)

This is not an official Google product.
